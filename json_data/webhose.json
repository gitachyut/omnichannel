The stock came under pressure soon after the local equity market opened Friday and selling continued and increased to further depreciate the stock by the end of the session, the dealers said.\"The August sales show it is unlikely that HTC will make any immediate turnaround,\" Hua Nan Securities analyst Kevin Su said.\"While HTC has announced the launch of new models later this year, the chances are slim that that the company's sales will increase accordingly, as it faces stiff market competition,\" he said.Last week, HTC said it will put its latest mid-range model -- the HTC U12 Life -- on sale in Taiwan in October, hoping that the new device will attract buying and help the company secure alternative sales.In a statement released Thursday, HTC said it posted NT$1.39 billion on consolidated sales in August, a new low since August 2003, when its revenue stood at NT$1.33 billion. The August sales were down 53.72 percent from a year earlier and also down 0.78 percent from a month earlier.In the first eight months of this year, HTC's consolidated sales totaled NT$18.35 billion, down 53.96 percent from a year earlier.Friday's closing level was just a small fraction of the NT$1,300.00 that HTC shares hit in late April 2011, the highest level for the company and any other stock listed in the local equity market at that time, as the brand once grasped a large market share in the United States as well as other major markets. But since then, the stock has moved lower as the company's sales have been on the decline.Dealers said that although HTC has intensified its efforts to penetrate the global virtual reality market by launching its first VR headset -- the HTC Vive -- in 2015, its VR operations have failed to give a significant boost to the company's sales.Faced with worsening financial results, HTC announced a layoff of 1,500 employees in early July, about 25 percent of its global workforce. The layoffs are expected to be completed by the end of September, with the manufacturing sector in Taiwan affected the most.In the second quarter, HTC incurred NT$2.09 billion in net losses, or a loss of NT$2.53 per share, compared with NT$25.70 in earnings per share for the first quarter. The first-quarter profit came after HTC sold its smartphone ODM assets to Google Inc. for US$1.1 billion.In 2017, HTC incurred net losses of NT$16.91 billion and a loss per share of NT$20.58, the highest since its listing on the local main board in March 2002.

In addition, such sluggish sessions hurt operational efficiency of the local securities industry.The commission said that after consulting with the local securities industry, the practice of compensatory Saturday sessions will end next year with no stock delivery, even if the local banking sector works on those days.

(TSMC), the most heavily weighted stock in the local market, appeared resilient, the broader market still weakened as investors were also concerned over a possible fund exodus from the region, the dealers said.The weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE), or Taiex, ended down 77.31 points, or 0.71 percent, at 10,846.99, after moving between 10,807.56 and 10,922.55, on turnover of NT$148.76 billion (US$4.83 billion).The market opened down 1.75 points and selling escalated as investors took cues from a falling Wall Street, where the tech-heavy Nasdaq index closed down 0.91 percent and the S&P 500 index ended down 0.37 percent, the dealers said.Downward pressure on the local main board continued in reflection of the weakness of other regional markets amid fears over the Washington-Beijing trade dispute before some bargain hunters emerged to help the Taiex recover some of its earlier losses by the end of the session, they said.\"Many investors were holding their breath, watching closely to see when the U.S. will announce the latest list of tariffs on additional Chinese goods worth US$200 billion,\" Hua Nan Securities analyst Kevin Su said.China's Ministry of Commerce has said that if the U.S. implements the new tariffs, the Chinese government will retaliate. Market analysts fear that an escalation of the trade war between the world's two largest economies will undermine global demand and slow down the pace of economic recovery.\"So investors here tended to cut their holdings and keep their money for the moment, which is why the broader market continued a downtrend from a session earlier,\" Su said. On Thursday, the Taiex closed down 0.64 percent.Among the falling stocks, iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., second to TSMC in terms of market value, fell 2.02 percent to close at NT$77.70 after the stock fell below the NT$80 mark, and memory chip maker Nanya Technology Corp. shed 9.59 percent to end at NT$57.50 amid fears of falling DRAM prices in the global market.Smartphone brand HTC Corp. lost 6.56 percent to close at NT$39.90, the lowest level since the company launched a listing in Taiwan in March 2002, as investors were motivated by its poor sales in August, which fell to a 15-year low of NT$1.39 billion.\"Fortunately, TSMC posted gains to prevent the broader market from falling further,\" Su said. \"I guess the buying in TSMC came from foreign institutional investors who wanted to use the stock to support the index, as they still owned plenty of long position futures contracts.\"TSMC rose 1.15 percent to close at NT$264.00, with 38.62 million shares changing hands. According to the TWSE, foreign institutional investors bought a net NT$1.03 billion-worth of shares on the main board Friday.Also outperforming the broader market, Largan Precision Co., a smartphone camera lens supplier to Apple Inc., rose 1.94 percent to close at NT$4,730,00, giving additional support to the Taiex, Su said.\"Selling focused on tech stocks today, so old economy stocks seemed resilient throughout the session,\" Su said.In the old economy sector, China Steel Structure Corp. gained 3.27 percent to close at NT$28.40 and Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corp. gained 0.42 percent to end at NT$120.00, while Formosa Plastics Corp. closed unchanged at NT$111.50.\"Investors have to keep alert over the recent weakness of currencies in emerging economies at a time of a rate hike in the U.S.,\" Su said. \"There are fears that a stronger greenback will lead fund outflows from the region.\" (By Frances Huang)","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","language":"english","external_links":[],"entities":{"persons":[],"organizations":[{"name":"cna","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"tsmc","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"nasdaq","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co.","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"taiwan stock exchange","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"s&p","sentiment":"none"}],"locations":[{"name":"taiwan","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"taipei","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"united states","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"china","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"washington","sentiment":"none"}]},"rating":null,"crawled":"2018-09-07T16:06:38.007+03:00"},{"thread":{"uuid":"3fe1dd7158e154d4abd33a3cef89e8da528adf4d","url":"http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxcEBuZDwTBvTN..l5uy8TQCI0Fc1biwZdHYiTWwRnUMP9gw6SxOJlwgHyHb9VK3iE-","site_full":"focustaiwan.tw","site":"focustaiwan.tw","site_section":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/rsscna/engnews","site_categories":["media"],"section_title":"Latest | FOCUS TAIWAN -

The relatively small growth reflected a higher comparison base last year for the semiconductor industry and a steeper decline in flat panel exports, the MOF said.Exports posted by the local semiconductor industry rose only 0.4 percent from a year earlier to US$8.39 billion in August, it said.In August, exports of machinery and plastics/rubber items rose 1.8 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively, from a year earlier to US$2.31 billion and US$2.11 billion, while outbound sales in base metal fell 3.5 percent to US$2.44 billion, the data showed.Exports in information communications and audio/video devices rose 0.3 percent from a year earlier to about US$2.90 billion in August, while outbound sales in optoelectronic devices fell 14.3 percent to US$998 million, the data indicated.The MOF said China/Hong Kong remained the largest buyer of Taiwan's goods in August, accounting for 41.5 percent of total exports. The value stood at US$11.73 billion, up 3.0 percent from a year earlier, the MOF added.The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) came in second after buying US$4.73 billion worth of goods from Taiwan in August, making up 16.7 percent of the total, a fall of 11.5 percent from a year earlier, the MOF said.Tsai said the decline in exports to the ASEAN bloc largely reflected a fall in electronics sales to Singapore, as well as a decline in mineral sales to the Philippines.Taiwan's exports to the U.S. market rose 2.7 percent from a year earlier to US$3.33 billion in August, while exports to Europe and Japan hit US$2.64 billion and US$1.85 billion, respectively, up 6.7 percent and 7.6 percent from a year earlier, the MOF added.Looking ahead, Tsai said Taiwanese exporters should stay alert over global trade frictions, the fluctuations in the Taiwan dollar, and rising competition, in particular from efforts by China to cultivate its own industries.

He is suspected to have killed Canadian Ramgahan Sanjay Ryan on Aug. 21.The suspect, a tattoo artist, has been described by Taiwan's media as a drug dealer.Sandoval told CNA that Mayer's deportation process is already in progress.Based on information obtained by the immigration bureau, Mayer is an American national and there are no records of him also having Israeli citizenship, Sandoval said.Asked if Mayer could refuse to be sent to Taiwan and instead request to be deported to the U.S. or Israel, the spokeswoman said the suspect must comply with whatever arrangements are made by Philippine authorities.However, there are still many uncertainties, she said.Taiwan currently does not have an extradition treaty with the Philippines.

He added that the relationship between the two countries should be changed from \"non-official to official.\"Tsai also expressed wishes that Taiwan can play an important role in U.S. President Donald Trump's foreign affairs strategy, adding that for example, Taiwan can work with the U.S. and Japan in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.The delegation is expected to meet with members of the U.S. Congress and officials, Tsai said.Since TAIUNA was formed in 2003, the alliance's representatives have been heading to the U.N. headquarters in New York every year to call for Taiwan's inclusion in the U.N. This year is the 15th year TAIUNA is doing so.The delegation plans to mobilize up to 1,000 people to gather in front of the U.N. headquarters to make its wish heard.

They are all produced by the company.Wei Jen-ting (魏任廷), an official with FDA's Food Safety Division, said the administration made the decision after it received a total of 629 customer complaints in the first eight months of this year over these products.An investigation later found that many of the complaints were related to rancidity and putrid tastes in the products, Wei said.According to the FDA, a total of 1.72 million cans of the affected items were imported from the United States between January and August this year.As a precautionary measure, the administration has given the manufacturer a 48-hour notice to remove the products from Taiwan's store shelves until further testing can be done, Wei said.The company has yet to provide a guarantee to health authorities that their products posed no threat to safety, according to Wei.Businesses that fail to comply with the food safety regulations and report to authorities over items that could cause health issues will be subject to fines of between NT$30,000 (US$980) and NT$3 million, Wei said.

And I hope we will work together to conquer them and go through the difficult times,\" Abe added.In her Twitter message, Tsai said: \"As a friend of Japan, Taiwan hopes it can help Japan go through such a difficult time. Taiwan has an obligation to do so.\"She added: \"Taiwan is ready to send a 40-member special search and rescue team and have two relief dogs with necessary equipment on standby... We will continue to lend support to Japan.\"In addition to the Twitter message, Tsai has instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to convey her concerns and condolences to Japan and has expressed hope that the impact of the trembler will be minimal.

Due to its long distance from Taiwan, the CWB does not expect it to affect Taiwan anytime soon.But it will watch closely whether Mangkhut, which is moving in a westerly direction, will get closer to Taiwan by next weekend.

Analysts say Washington may be worried Beijing will have too much influence in its backyard. (By Chiang Chin-yeh, Yeh Su-ping and Y.F.

Hotai Motor took a 24.4 percent share in the local car market, the data showed.China Motor Corp., which markets cars under the Mitsubishi marque, came in second by taking a 12.5 percent share in August after selling 3,262 units, down 34.9 percent from a month earlier and also down 19.6 percent from a year earlier.The smaller decline suffered by China Motor came after the vendor benefited from a delivery of commercial vehicles to Chunghwa Post Co., while its dealers tried hard to lower van inventories ahead of the launch of a new version of Veryca in the fourth quarter, analysts said.Mazda and Mercedes Benz came in third and fourth in August after selling 1,866 units and 1,754 units, respectively, to grasp a 7.2 percent share and a 6.74 percent share in August. The two imported car vendors even fended off headwinds in the Ghost Month to outperform Yulon Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Taiwan, two strong Taiwanese competitors.Yulon Nissan Motor, which sells models under the Nissan brand, sold 1,633 units to take a 6.3 percent share and the fifth spot in August, while Honda Taiwan ranked sixth place after selling 1,596 units to hold a 6.1 percent share, the data showed.Since local car brands suffered the steepest decline in sales in August, their foreign counterparts accounted for 50.5 percent of total sales in the month, the first time they took over half the market in more than a decade, analysts said.They added that Taiwanese vendors, including Hotai Motor, China Motor and Honda Taiwan, are planning to launch new models soon in a bid to attract customers back to the market after Ghost Month.

The August figure was the highest since November 2017, when Largan's consolidated sales stood at NT$5.61 billion.In the month, 20 mega-pixel lenses or more advanced lenses which command a higher profit margin, accounted for 10-20 percent of Largan's total sales, 10 mega-pixel lenses or higher made up 50-60 percent, and 8 mega-pixel lenses represented 10-20 percent, the company said.In the first eight months of this year, Largan generated about NT$32 billion in consolidated sales, up 1.26 percent from a year earlier.Largan said in the statement, its September sales would be little changed from August because of its limited production capacity and a need to improve yield rate.Shrugging off Largan's September sales forecast, the Japanese brokerage said it expects the company to benefit from peak season effects in the second half of the year when Apple and Chinese smartphone brands unveil their new models to boost buying.The Japanese securities house said Largan's sales for the second half of this year could rise 56 percent from the first half and its net profit is expected to rise 87 percent from the first six months as upgraded specifications adopted by international brands boost Largan's sales and earnings.Due to Largan's lead over its peers in production technology, the Japanese securities house said, the Taiwanese firm remains one of the top supplier choices for the new iPhones.The Japanese brokerage said Largan's net profit could rise 31 percent from a year earlier in 2019.On the other hand, the more cautious U.S. brokerage said it expected slower year-on-year sales growth in September, reflecting falling product prices and competition from Taiwan-based rival Genius Electronic Optical Co.The U.S. brokerage said it preferred to take a wait-and-see approach to Largan before Apple launches its new iPhones, likely next week.CNA cannot identify the brokerages because media outlets in Taiwan are not allowed to report the names of foreign brokerages when they give price-moving forecasts for specific stocks or the wider market.

Tests later confirmed on Friday that she had contracted the type 1 (DENV-1) dengue virus infection, according to the CDC.Meanwhile, Yonghe District also reported its first case of indigenous dengue fever that day. The patient is a woman in her 30s, who also contracted the type 1 virus, CDC Deputy Director-General Philip Lo (羅一鈞) said.Health authorities have since disinfected the area around her residence and also called on the public to help prevent the disease from spreading by keeping their living quarters clean of stagnant water, where mosquitoes breed, Lo said.Other newly confirmed cases this week included in Taichung City and Xinzhuang District in New Taipei, both of which have been hard hit by the disease this year.Taichung reported three more patients, while Xinzhuang also saw another three, Lo said.As of Sept. 8, a total of 92 indigenous dengue fever cases had been reported in Taiwan this year, including 50 in Taichung, 31 in New Taipei, five in Kaohsiung, two each in Taipei City and Chiayi County, and one each in Taoyuan and Changhua County, according to the CDC.

It now partners with 64 universities in 24 countries in running collaborative projects.Over the last 14 years, the ministry, one of several public funding sources, has provided US$12 million for such programs, said Andy Bi (畢祖安), head of the Department of International and Cross-Strait Education, at the congress Saturday.The funding was mainly used to help international universities establish Taiwan studies courses, sponsor scholarly visit and exchanges, issue Taiwan studies publications, provide scholarships, hold academic activities and enrich databases and archive, Bi said.\"We are still envisioning new projects,\" Bi added, including the possibility of helping international universities create more full-time teaching positions.Bi's comment was a positive response to the \"Manifesto for the Further Development and Entrenchment of Taiwan Studies Within Global Academia,\" a joint statement 21 scholars, mostly from countries in Europe, co-signed and presented at the congress.The manifesto urged Taiwan's government to create an integrated public funding structure to coordinate its funding and to support the development of Taiwan studies more effectively so as to institutionalize Taiwan studies within global academia.Scott Simon, who represents Taiwan Studies at Ottawa University, said Saturday that a big challenge faced by the institution is the lack of consistent funding.Ottawa University has had an extensive range of exchange programs with several universities in Taiwan and it has given Taiwan priority at its very highest level, even selecting Taiwan as one of the 12 countries it partners with under its innovative International Research Acceleration Program, Simon said.When he talked about difficulties, he said that one of the most important is that \"funding needs to be more consistent.\"\"We have to re-apply every now and then. I think it is important that it doesn't break down. This is a good investment for Taiwan to make,\" Simon said.In the case of SOAS University in London, Dafydd Fell, director of the university's Center of Taiwan Studies, said that while the U.K. has about seven universities with courses on Taiwan, SOAS is the only one that has a course with Taiwan in the title.\"Of course, running Taiwan studies course isn't easy. We were constantly under pressure -- do we have enough students?\" Fell said, but with right design, strategies and luck, \"teaching programs can be sustainable.\"Fell said that short-term funding has been a core topic among Taiwan studies scholars. \"We have been very lucky that we have continuous Taiwan funding since 1999. MOE funding is quite critical to the way we expand it. Again that takes persuasion.\"Gunter Schubert, director of the European Research Center on Contemporary Taiwan based in the University of Tubingen, Germany, said that almost no faculty positions for Taiwan studies scholars have been created in universities in the West for the past 15 years, despite the steady development of Taiwan studies.In addition to funding issues that need to be addressed, Schubert suggested that Taiwan studies scholars should argue that Taiwan studies are an indispensable complement to China studies as a way of persuading universities to create faculty positions for Taiwan studies scholars.\"China is and will always be the 'big elephant' that you cannot do away with when arguing for faculty positions for Taiwan (studies) scholars,\" Schubert said in his presentation Friday.It is much better to reason for an institutionalized Taiwan studies field within a Western University by intellectually engaging a rising China than attempting to distance Taiwan from China or de-linking Taiwan studies from China studies, he said.Schubert's suggestion rose some eyebrows in the audience and was laster asked whether such an approach would not pave the way for China to suppressing the development of Taiwan studies in Western universities.If you want to convince university authorities that you need Taiwan studies scholars, you can't do so without making a point concerning China, because China studies scholars and their departments are very institutionalized in the universities, Schubert said when asked by CNA to elaborate on his point.“You have to make an argument why Taiwan is important to understand China. Otherwise it’s really hard to convince department colleagues in university authorities to integrate Taiwan scholars in that department,” he said.A participant who represents the newly established Taiwan Institute at the University of Central Lancashire in the U.K. said Saturday that the university supports the Institute but is worried about possible repercussions.\"We regularly got asked what would happen if China says anything about it,\" he said, asking the panelists to share experiences in dealing with pressure from China.Simon told a story from a few years ago in which the university bowed to the China's embassy in Ottawa after it protested over the appearance of a Republic of China flag on a website promoting an event hosted by his institution.The flag was taken down from the website and \"we were told that we shall never again use any symbol or language that might offend the Chinese embassy in Ottawa,\" he said.\"We can't let ourselves be censored by a foreign embassy. But, there is a danger ahead of us. We have to aware of that and we have to have a strategy,\" Simon said.

He is suspected to have killed Canadian Ramgahan Sanjay Ryan on Aug. 21.The suspect, a tattoo artist, has been described by Taiwan's media as a drug dealer.Sandoval told CNA that Mayer's deportation process is already in progress.Based on information obtained by the immigration bureau, Mayer is an American national and there are no records of him also having Israeli citizenship, Sandoval said.Asked if Mayer could refuse to be sent to Taiwan and instead request to be deported to the U.S. or Israel, the spokeswoman said the suspect must comply with whatever arrangements are made by Philippine authorities.However, there are still many uncertainties, she said.Taiwan currently does not have an extradition treaty with the Philippines.

H. Chen (陳和賢), director of the Science and Technology Division under the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in India.Items such as Taiwan's self-developed miniature satellites, known as CubeSat, were highly praised, while a number of Indian academics and industrial experts have already begun exploring opportunities to cooperate with Taiwan, Chen said.This year, Taiwan's participation at the Indian fair was led by the National Space Organization (NSPO), a national space agency involved in the development of space technologies and related research.During the event, researcher Fang Chen-chou (方振洲) who was involved in the FormoSat-3 project, met with Rakesh Sasibhushan, chairman and managing director of Antrix Corporation, to explore the possibility of future cooperative projects between Taiwan and India.Antrix is the commercial arm of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the country's national space agency.The biennial space expo, touted as the largest event of its kind in Asia, was held from Sept. 6-8, with more than 100 exhibitors, space agency representatives and delegates from the United States, France, Russia, Taiwan and other countries taking part.

This shows a potential shift in the investment intentions of Taiwanese businesses.Chang Ming-pin (張銘斌), director general of the MOEA's Department of Investment Services, said most domestic companies interested in investing in China are eying the domestic market there, while most considering relocating are doing so because of the deteriorating operating environment in China, but not necessary due to the fallout from the U.S.-China trade war.As to whether China-based Taiwanese businesses will move their operations back to Taiwan, CIER President Wu Chung-shu (吳中書) said that given Taiwan's relatively strict environmental regulations, research and development or capital-intensive industries are most likely to return.

He was later charged with violation of the Sexual Harassment Prevention Act after the victims reported the assaults to the police.Aron was found guilty of the first two attacks at Taiwan Shilin District Court on Sept. 3 and sentenced to two months in jail on each of the two charges, with the penalties combined to a three-month term of imprisonment, which can be commuted to a fine of NT$90,000 (US$2,920), the verdict said.In addition, the district court also found Aron guilty on charges of sexually harassing a female judicial police officer and a female interpreter on May 21 when attending a court hearing on the earlier charges.The court sentenced Aron to two months for those assaults, with the penalty commutable to a fine of NT$60,000. The case was declared closed.Aron will be deported upon completion of his sentence or payment of the fine, the document said, noting that the case was closed after the American's appeal was rejected.Under Taiwan's Sexual Harassment Prevention Act, individuals who kiss, hug or sexually touch others without consent are subject to imprisonment for a period of less than two years, forced labor service under detention, or a separate or a fine of up to NT$100,000.Such offenses are only prosecuted after the police receive a complaint, according to the act.

On average, a suicide impacts at least six other people, Liao said citing WHO data.Individuals with a history of attempted suicide form a well-defined high-risk group for suicide, TSS President Lee Ming-been (李明濱) noted, adding that such attempts are associated with increased risk of death by suicide.The number of reported suicide attempts has also increased over the past few years. In 2017, 26,000 suicide attempts were reported, up 4.17 percent from 2016.While women more often have suicidal thoughts, men die by suicide more frequently, according to Lee.Around 1.328 million people, or 6.5 percent of Taiwan's population suffered from emotional problems in 2017, Lee said, citing a survey conducted by the suicide prevention center established by the TSS.In addition, Lee went on, about 1.5 percent of people aged 15 and older surveyed, or 300,000 individuals, thought about committing suicide over the past year, while 11.5 percent have had suicidal thoughts at some time.

The driver landed on the roof of the vehicle before falling to the ground, according a CCTV recording.The two migrant workers were taken to a nearby hospital where they were found to have suffered only flesh wounds, police said.Liu Huang-lin (劉滉潾), deputy head of the county's police bureau, said that sobriety test results found the driver of the electric bicycle had a breath alcohol content of 0.45 milligrams per liter and he has been referred for further investigation.Local residents have recently complained on social media that migrant workers on electric bicycles do not observe traffic regulations, including driving the wrong way down one way streets, running red lights and competing for lane space.Liu said police have stepped up punishment of law breaking behavior in the area around Nang Kung Industrial Park and downtown Nantou City and will work together with employers to ensure migrant workers are aware of and respect Taiwan's traffic laws.There are about 10,000 foreign workers in Nantou County, 6,000 of whom work at Nang Kung Indutrial Park, according to Liu.

His office in Tokyo will convene a meeting Monday to review post-disaster relief work that has previously been criticized by many.Earlier, the diplomat was slammed on social media for being unprofessional after staff at Taiwan's representative office in Japan were accused in a PTT post of being reluctant to help Taiwanese in Osaka who sought assistance after massive flooding caused by Typhoon Jebi led to the closure of Kansai International Airport Tuesday.PTT is one of the most popular bulletin boards in Taiwan.Meanwhile, several opposition Kuomintang lawmakers denounced Hsieh at a press conference in Taipei Friday for failing to help Taiwanese in need.

It advised that eastern Taiwan, the outlying islands and areas north of Chiayi should be on the alert for strong wind gusts.By Monday night, the rain will ease off in northern and northeastern Taiwan and move into Hualien, Taitung and the Hengchun Peninsula, the CWB said.On Monday, daytime highs are forecast at 28-30 degrees Celsius in northern and eastern Taiwan and 30-32 degrees in other parts of the country, according to the CWB.
